# ToDoPy

ToDoPy is a full-featured task management application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks efficiently. The application uses **React Router** for client-side routing and **Mongoose** for modeling and interacting with MongoDB.

## 📌 Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- Persistent storage using MongoDB
- RESTful API for task management
- Frontend routing with React Router
- Fully responsive design
